# My Carbon App - Carbon Footprint Calculator

`My Carbon App` is a desktop application designed to help users calculate their annual carbon footprint. The application considers various factors from daily life, including breathing, transportation, waste, and diet, to provide a total estimate of CO₂ emissions.

This project was developed within the Erasmus+ program "Gender, Digitalization, Green: Ensuring a Sustainable Future for all in Europe"

## Project Context

This project is the result of an international academic partnership between the following universities:
* University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest, Romania
* National University of Science and Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest, Romania
* Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain
* University of Porto, Portugal
* Uzhhorod National University, Ukraine

## Features

* **Modular Calculator:** Calculates the carbon footprint based on three main categories: Individual, Home, and Diet.
* **Individual Details:** Includes calculations for emissions from breathing and transportation methods (Personal Car, Public Transport, Bicycle, Scooter, Walking).
* **Waste Details:** Estimates annual CO₂ emissions from paper and plastic waste.
* **Clear Results:** Displays a detailed summary of the total carbon footprint (in kg CO₂/year).
* **Personalized Feedback:** Provides the user with an encouraging message based on their results.
